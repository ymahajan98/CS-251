\section{Introduction}
Sorting is one of the most fundamental operations in computer science useful in numerous applications. Given a sequence of numbers as input, the output should provide a non-decreasing sequence of numbers as output. More formally, we define a sorting problem as follows [1],\\
\textbf{Input:}A sequence of n numbers $\big \langle a_1,a_2,...,a_n \big \rangle$.\\
\textbf{Output:}A recorded sequence (of size n) $\big \langle a'_1,a'_2,...,a'_n \big \rangle$ of the input sequence such that $a'_1<=a'_2<=...<=a'_n,$.\\
Consider the following example.Given an input sequence \big \langle8,34,7,9,15,91,15\big \rangle, a sorting algorithm should return \big \langle7,8,9,15,15,34,91\big \rangle as output.\\
\indent A fundamental problem like sorting has attracted
many researchers who contributed with innovative
algorithms to solve the problem of sorting \textit{efficiently} [3]. Efficiency of an algorithm depends on
primarily on two aspects,
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Time complexity} is a formalism that captures running time of an algorithm in terms of the input size.Normally, \textit{asymptotic} behavior on the input size is used to analyze the time complexity of algorithms.
  \item \textbf{Space complexity} is a formalism that cap-
tures amount of memory used by an algorithm
in terms of input size. Like time complexity
analysis, asymptotic analysis is used for space
complexity.
\end{itemize}
In the branch of algorithms and complexity in computer science, space complexity takes a back seat
compared to time complexity. Recently, another
parameter of computing i.e., energy consumption
has become popular. Roy et al. [4] proposed an energy complexity model for algorithms. In this document, we will deal with time complexity of sorting
algorithms.\\
\indent One class of algorithms which are based on \textit{element comparison} are commonly known as \textit{comparison based sorting algorithms}. In this document we will provide a brief overview of \texttt{Quicksort}, a commonly
used comparison based sorting algorithm [2].Quicksort
is a sorting algorithm based on \textit{divide-and-conquer}
paradigm of algorithm design. Further,we will derive the lower bound of any comparison based sorting algorithm to be $\Omega(n$ $log_2 n$) for an input size of n.
\section{Quicksort}~\\
Quicksort is designed as a three-step divide-and-
conquer process for sorting an input sequence in
an array [1].For any given subarray, A[i..j], the
process is as follows,\\
\textbf{Divide:} The array A[i..j] is partitioned into two
subarrays A[i..k] and A[k + 1..j] such that all elements in A[i..k] is less than or equal to all elements
in A[k + 1..j]. A partitioning procedure is called to
determine k such that at the end of partitioning,the element at the $k^{th}$ position (i.e., A[k]) does not change its position in the final output array.

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
  \Procedure{Partition}{A,i,j}\newline
 \Comment{A is an array of N integers,A[1,N]}\newline
 \Comment{i and j are the start and the end of subarray}
       \State $x \leftarrow$ A[i]
       \State $y \leftarrow$ i-1
       \State $z \leftarrow$ j+1
       \While {(\textit{true})}
           \State $z \leftarrow z-1$
        \While {$A[z]>x$}
        \State $z \leftarrow z-1$ 
        \EndWhile
        \State $y \leftarrow y+1$ 
         \While {$A[y]<x$}
        \State $y \leftarrow y+1$
        \EndWhile
        \If {$y<z$}
        \State Swap $A[y]  \leftrightarrow A[z]$
        \Else
          \State  \Return z
        \EndIf
       \EndWhile
    \EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
\noindent \textbf{Conquer:} Recursively invoke \texttt{Quicksort} on the two subarrays.This procedure conquers the complexity by applying the same operations in two subarrays.\\~\\
\textbf{Merge:}Quicksort does not require merge or com- bine operation as the entire array A[i..j] is sorted in place.\\
\indent In the heart of \texttt{Quicksort}, there is a partition procedure as shown in Algorithm 1. A pivot element x is selected. The first inner while loop (line \#6) continues examining elements until it finds an element that is smaller than or equal to the pivot element. Similarly, the second inner while loop (line \#9) continues examining elements until it finds an element that is greater than or equal to the pivot element. If indices y and z have not exchanged their side around the pivot, the elements at A[y] and A[z] are exchanged. Otherwise, the procedure returns the index z, such that all elements to the left of z are smaller than or equal to A[z] and all elements to the right of z are greater than or equal to A[z].\\
\indent The main recursive procedure for \texttt{Quicksort} 
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Quicksort recursion}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
  \Procedure{Quicksort}{A,i,j}\newline
 \Comment{Quicksort procedure called with A, 1, N}
        \If {$i<j$}
        \State $k  \leftarrow$\textsc{Partition}(A,i,j)
        \State \textsc{Quicksort}(A,i,k)
        \State \textsc{Quicksort}(A,k+1,j)
        \EndIf
    \EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}\\
is presented in Algorithm 2. Initial invocation is performed by call QUICKSORT(A, 1, N ) where N is the length of array N.
\subsection{Time complexity analysis of \texttt{Quicksort}}
The worst case of \texttt{Quicksort} occurs when an array of length N , gets partitioned into two subarrays of size N-1 and 1 in every recursive invocation of QUICKSORT procedure in Algorithm 2. The partitioning procedure presented in Algorithm 1, takes $\Theta$(n) time, the recurrence relation for running time
is,
\begin{equation*}
    T(n)=T(n-1)+\Theta(n)
\end{equation*}
As it is evident that T (1) = $\Theta$(1), the recurrence is solved as follows,
\begin{align*}
T(n)& =T(n-1)+\Theta(n)\\
& =\sum_{k=1}^{n} \Theta(k)        \\ 
& =\Theta \Bigg (\sum_{k=1}^{n} k \Bigg )\\
& =\Theta (n^2)
\end{align*}
\indent Therefore, if the partitioning is always maximally unbalanced, the running time is $\Theta(n^2)$. Intutively,f an input sequence is almost sorted, \texttt{Quicksort} will perform poorly. In the best case, partitioning divides the array into two equal parts. Thus, the recurrence for the best case is given by,
\begin{equation*}
    T(n)=2T\bigg(\frac{n}{2}\bigg)+\Theta(n)
\end{equation*}
which evaluates to $\Theta$(n $log_2 n)$. Using a comparatively involved analysis, the average running time of \texttt{Quicksort} can be determined to be O($n$ lg $n$).
\newpage
\section{Lower bounds on comparison sorts}
An interesting question about sorting algorithms
based on comparisons is the following: What is
the lower bound of this class of sorting algorithms? This question is important for algorithm
researchers to further improve the sorting algorithms.\\
\indent A decision tree based analysis leads to the fol- lowing theorem [1].\\
\textbf{Theorem 1.}\textit{ Any decision tree that sorts n elements has height $\Omega(n log_2(n)$.}\\
\textit{Proof.} Consider a decision tree of height h that sorts n elements. Since there are n$!$ permutations of n elements, each permutation representing a distinct sorted order, the tree must have at least n$!$ leaves. Since a binary tree of height h has no more than $2^h$ leaves. So,
\begin{flalign*}
      & n\leq2^h &
\end{flalign*}
Applying logarithmic ($log_2$), the inequality be-
comes,
\begin{flalign*}
   & h\geq lg(n!) &
\end{flalign*}
Applying Stirling’s approximations,
\begin{flalign*}
   & n!>\bigg(\frac{n}{e}\bigg)^n &
\end{flalign*}
where e is natural base of logarithms. Further,
\begin{align*}
h& \geq lg\bigg(\frac{n}{e}\bigg)^n\\
& =nlg n-nlg e\\ 
& =\Omega(n lg n)
\end{align*}
